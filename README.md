# My Personal Site

**Welcome:**

This repo is for my re-build of my personal portfolio. The internet has changed a lot since I wrote my very first personal website for fun. Thinking back through the years that have passed since then, I took some cuse from the enduring style of that time for the theme of this page. The twist of course is that this page makes use of modern web tech in subtle ways to present a whimsical and dynamic website.
